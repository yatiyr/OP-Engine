Project opium is in its baby steps. I have been watching  @TheCherno's [Game Engine Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) and learnt a lot about how game engines are built by looking at how he builds his **Hazel Engine**.

I've been writing the code while watching him so current code base of the engine pretty much looks like Public Hazel :D. But from now on (March 3rd 2019), I'll mostly do my own thing. This series thought me a lot and now its time to diverge and build something unique.

## Changelog:
- v0.0.1 Opium has Entity Component System, 2D Batch renderer (Only supports OpenGL), ImGui, C# Scripting (needs a rework)
